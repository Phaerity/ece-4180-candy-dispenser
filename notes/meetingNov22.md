# Notes
## Diagramming robot
We drew out how the robot looks in full, including all parts and where they will be in relation to the robot:
![Whiteboard drawings](../main/diagrams/whiteboardNotes.png)  
Felicia diagrammed a 3D version of the robot in Paint 3D

### There will be 3 "levels" built out of wood:
1. Bottom level houses the mbed, motors, and bluetooth for the robot chassis
2. Middle level is open for a hand to insert into - like a square with 3 sides
3. Top level is the actual dispenser, with the candy
### Changing LED array to individual for fullness status
To avoid having to take it apart at the end of the semester - **add to the report** since changed from the original design
### Structure to dispense the candy is similar to a windmill, turns 90 degrees to dispense
There will be a rectangular hole at the bottom of the actual dispenser
### Inside the actual dispenser, we can install slanted boards to help with candy not getting stuck at the corners (OPTIONAL)
### The mbed and speaker for the actual dispenser will be mounted on the back, exposed
### The sonar will be on the ceiling of the dispenser
### The lid will be separate from the box
Will need to be detachable - hinge, velcro, tape, etc.

# TODO
Port to github.com, github.gatech.edu will require logon for the grader  
Finish wood stuff by Dec. 3 - Invention Studio will close by then so no laser cutter
