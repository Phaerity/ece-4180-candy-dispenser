# 11/15/21 Virtual Meeting

Members present: Ikenna, Felicia, Harneet, Anna

## Splitting project into 4 parts
1. Motion sensing + opening/closing latch (lidar + servo) - Anna
    - Ikenna has motion sensing code for arduino from previous project
2. Robot chassis + bluetooth (bluefruit app) to drive + power (on its own mbed) - Ikenna
3. Sonar + LED array (status for fullness) + building the box - Felicia
4. LEDs (+ LCD maybe) for decoration (open for interpretation) + speaker/sound + power (battery pack) - Harneet

All help with robot if needed  
Next meeting draw out how it all looks together (esp. box)

## Requirements:
Documentation on the project web page must include team member names, a parts list, schematic, source code, photos, and videos.  

The web page should explain the project idea, provide instructions, code, and hardware setups so that anyone could recreate your project along with photos and videos along with team member names. It might make sense to have a longer video on the web page 

### Ask Dr. Hamblen:
Show what we have, see if it's what he meant (Github documentation)  
Is github.gatech.edu okay?  
Lab still open?

### Other notes:
Maybe don't use LED array because will have to return it - uLCD instead of this? ask Oscar or Maddie

## Schedule:
Dec. 15 - presentation day  
Dec. 1 & 6 - class time to put everything together
