# üç≠Automated Candy Dispenserüç¨ (ECE 4180 Fall 2021)
Made by: Ikenna Nwokedi, Harneet Sethi, Felicia E, Anna Yue

## üç´Project Descriptionüç´
This device dispenses candy in a hands-free manner, similar to how hands-free soap dispensers work. The dispenser will use a lidar to detect motion and a DC motor to spin some blades that release candy. Inside the dispenser, there is a sonar to detect how much candy is left, and this information is displayed as a status bar using colored LEDs. The dispenser itself will sit on a robot chassis such that someone can drive it around using Bluetooth.

# Instructions
## Cutting the Box
We started off by creating box using the website https://en.makercase.com/#/. The settings we used are as follows: Basic Box, Width 5 in., Height 8 in., Length 8 in., Outside dimensions, Material Thickness 1/4 in., Closed box, Finger joints sized 1.0915. These settings can be customized based on how big you want the dispenser to be and thickness of your wood. The box plans can be downloaded with labels disabled and separate panel layout, and these files can be used to laser cut the box at either the Hive or Invention Studio. The files we used are provided in the resources folder.  

Furthermore, the box must be modified so that the bottom level becomes like a shelf (see picture). What we did was cut rectangular holes into the sides of the box so that the shelf could "slide" in, but there are other ways to do it if preferable. The files we used to cut the holes are provided in the resources folder.  

## The Chassis
