# 🍭Hands-Free Candy Dispenser🍬 (ECE 4180 Fall 2021)
Made by: Ikenna Nwokedi, Harneet Sethi, Felicia E, Anna Yue

## 🍫Project Description🍫
This device dispenses candy in a hands-free manner, similar to how hands-free soap dispensers work. The dispenser will use a lidar to detect motion and a servo to open/close a hatch that releases candy. Inside the dispenser, there is a sonar to detect how much candy is left, and this information is displayed as a status bar using LEDs. The dispenser itself will sit on a robot chassis such that someone can drive it around using Bluetooth.
